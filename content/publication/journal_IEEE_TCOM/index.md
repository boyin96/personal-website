abstract: Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) improving by leaps and bounds has brought new possibilities for industrial manufacturing. Massive connectivity and multi-services are two major requirements for IIoT. In order to address the two main issues, we joint consider non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and wireless slicing in this work. We formulate the connectivity maximization problem with joint sub-carrier association and power allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To solve the problem effectively, we first split the MINLP problem into two subproblems by introducing a power allocation weight. Then, we propose the Layered Access (LA) algorithm to maximize the connectivity. Furthermore, a Bisection Search algorithm is devised to find out the optimal power allocation weight. Simulation results show that the proposed LA has better performance compared to other benchmark schemes.
