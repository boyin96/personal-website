title: Maximizing the Connectivity of Wireless Network Slicing Enabled
  Industrial Internet-of-Things
abstract: The emergence of 5G brings unprecedented possibilities for deploying
  the anticipated Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). To achieve high density
  connectivity with multiple services in 5G empowered IIoT, we consider the
  non-orthogonal network slicing in this work. In particular, we jointly utilize
  network slicing to incorporate two different types of services and exploit
  non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to maximize the number of total devices
  that can be accessed to the system. We formulate the connectivity maximization
  problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) by jointly optimizing
  the transmit power and device-subcarrier association. To tackle the
  intractable MINLP, we first transform it into a mixed-integer linear
  programming (MILP) and then reduce the MILP by devising a simple but effective
  transmit power allocation scheme. Thereafter, we propose a low-complexity
  best-effort pairing (BEP) algorithm to solve the reduced MILP. By
  comprehensive simulations, we find that our proposed BEP significantly
  outperforms the benchmark schemes.
